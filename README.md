# File Read & Write Program

This Python program demonstrates file handling by reading content from a file, modifying it, and writing the modified content to a new file. It also handles various errors gracefully, such as when the file doesn't exist or can't be read.

## Features

- **File Reading**: Opens and reads the content from an existing file.
- **File Modification**: Modifies the content (example: converting text to uppercase).
- **File Writing**: Writes the modified content to a new file.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors like file not found, I/O issues, and other unexpected errors.

## How to Use

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. **Download or Clone the Project**: Download the script or clone the repository.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `file_read_write.py` is saved.
   - Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python file_read_write.py
